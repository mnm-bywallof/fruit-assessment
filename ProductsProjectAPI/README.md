This project consists of an API and React front-end application.

# Backend API: ASP.net API
1. Clone this repo
2. Once the application has loaded onto Visual Studio 22 (recommended)
3. Build and Run the application.
4. A Swagger UI should present itself upon a successful build as shown on the image below:

# Front-end Application built in React.
Note: Please make sure nodejs is installed.
1. cd into front-end-fruit folder
2. Run the following commands to Install and Run the project
```
npm install
npm run build
```
NB: The API should be running first. And normally we do not place the Front-end application onto the API folder but there were a couple of issues then I just had to put together a working plan.
